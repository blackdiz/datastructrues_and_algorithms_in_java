# Practices of the Book Data Structure and Algorithms in Java
這是關於 Rober Lafore 的 Data Structures and Algorithms in Java (2nd Edition) 筆記，章節基本上和原書順序相同，偶而會依作者個人理解調整，程式碼基本上也和原書範例相同，但同樣會依作者想法而有稍微不同，若有問題歡迎指教，謝謝。
執行程式時請在資料夾下編譯執行即可，如：
```
cd chapter6/anagram
javac Anagrams.java
java Anagram
```


This repository contains practices of the book Data Structures and Algorithms in Java (2nd Edition) written by Rober Lafore, chapters are mostly the same as the original book but may have a little tweak by my thought. If there are any problems, please let me know, thank you.
For testing, you can go to the folder, then compile and run every program directly：
```
cd chapter6/anagram
javac Anagrams.java
java Anagram
```
